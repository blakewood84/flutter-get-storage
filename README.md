# flutter_get_storage

This project is testing Get Storage which saves synchronous key-values in meory lighting fast with Dart SDK.

When the app initializes  I am opening an Instance of GetStorage(), then writing quickly to memory the String "test".

After another screen loads I am calling the instance again and running a read() method to read the values contained in "test" container.
